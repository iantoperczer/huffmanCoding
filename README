##Style Guidelines:
  1. Line width shouldn't be more than 80 characters.
  2. Files should not contain tabs, or trailing whitespace.
  3. The identation should be 2 spaces.
  4. Every code block should be wrapped by braces:

    `if (condition) {
    `  /** Code here **/
    `} else {
    `  /** More code here **/
    `}

    Notice the spaces between if and the opening parenthesis and the space
    after the closing parenthesis. Also notice the spaces between the word else.
